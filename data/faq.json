    "question": "How long does the revamp process take?",
    "answer": "Timeline depends on the package you choose. Our Starter package takes 2-3 weeks, Growth takes 4-5 weeks, and Premium takes 6-8 weeks. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your free consultation and keep you updated throughout the process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to provide content and photos?",
    "answer": "We can work with what you have! For Starter and Growth packages, we'll help you organize existing content and photos. If you don't have professional photos, we can use quality stock images or you can add our photography session. The Premium package includes a professional half-day photo shoot at your facility."
  },
  {
    "question": "What platforms do you build websites on?",
    "answer": "We primarily use Wix and WordPress because they're user-friendly, allowing you to make simple updates yourself after launch. Both platforms are mobile-responsive, SEO-friendly, and don't require coding knowledge. We'll recommend the best fit based on your needs and comfort level."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I make changes to my website after it's launched?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! We build on platforms that are easy to update. During handoff, we provide training on how to make basic changes like updating text, adding photos, and posting updates. For more complex changes, we offer ongoing support packages or can handle updates for you at an hourly rate."

  {
    "question": "What's included in Google Business Profile optimization?",
    "answer": "We'll audit and optimize your entire profile: accurate business information, category selection, compelling description, photo optimization, service area setup, attributes, and more. We'll also develop a posting strategy to keep your profile active and show strategic review generation techniques to boost your ratings."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the online booking system work?",
    "answer": "We integrate a booking solution that lets parents schedule tours or consultations directly from your website. In Growth and Premium packages, we typically use Calendly (which syncs with your calendar) or a custom form that sends you email notifications. The Premium package includes more advanced features like waitlist management."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you write the content for my website?",
    "answer": "Yes! We handle all the copywriting based on information you provide during our onboarding questionnaire and kickoff call. We'll ask about your programs, philosophy, staff, and what makes you special. You'll have opportunities to review and request revisions to ensure the messaging sounds authentic to your center."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I need changes after my revisions are used?",
    "answer": "No problem! Each package includes a set number of revision rounds to ensure you're happy with the final product. If you need additional changes after those are complete, we offer them at $100/hour. Most clients find the included revisions are more than enough."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
    "answer": "Yes! We offer flexible payment plans to make our services accessible. Typically, we require 50% upfront to begin work and 50% upon completion. For Premium packages, we can arrange a three-payment schedule. Contact us to discuss what works best for your budget."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after my website launches?",
    "answer": "We don't just launch and disappear! All packages include post-launch support (duration varies by package). We'll monitor your site, provide training, and be available for questions. We also offer ongoing maintenance, monthly updates, and marketing support packages if you want continued partnership."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you measure success?",
    "answer": "We track key metrics that matter to your business: Google Business Profile views and actions, website traffic, tour booking inquiries, contact form submissions, and phone calls. With Premium packages, we provide monthly analytics reports showing how your digital presence is driving real results for your enrollment."
